Its programming model is based on cooperative multitasking and common system programming abstractions such as threads, sockets, files, subprocesses, locks, and queues. Under the covers, it is based on a task queuing system that is small, fast, and powerful.

It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, i/o, load and disk metrics. Additionally, it features an API for implementing custom collectors for gathering metrics from almost any source. http://diamond.readthedocs.org/
